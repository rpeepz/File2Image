# File2Image
A program I wrote to convert a given file to a series of images
filled with pixels which represent the data from that file.

It can also decode the image(s) back to it's original file.

## Usage
* Run `make` or `make build`

To Encode: `./File2Image [ File ]`
To Decode: `./File2Image -d f2i1.png`
