# File2Image
A program I wrote to convert a given file to a series of images
filled with pixels which represent the data from that file.

It can also decode the image(s) back to it's original file.

## Objective  
This projects goal is to generate an image or video from a file. The data in the created media is represented by RGB pixels in a 16x9 ratio. You can convert and store the information of the files in a portible universal format.

## Dependencies  
* [libpng][libpng]
* A C language compiler most common would be GCC or Clang.
* Cmake to run the custom Makefile for fast instalation.
* Code was written to run on Unix based systems, it would likely work on a windows machine too but is currently untested.
