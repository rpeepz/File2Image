A program I wrote to convert a given file to a series of images
filled with pixels which represent the data from that file.

It can also decode the image(s) back to it's original file.

## Objective  
This projects goal is to generate an image or video from a file. The data in the created media is represented by RGB pixels in a 16x9 ratio. You can convert and store the information of the files in a portible universal format.

-c : CONVERT a <ins>__f2i Image file__</ins> to f2i Video file

-m : MAP a <ins>__f2i Video file__</ins> to f2i Image file

-t : TRANSFORM a <ins>__file__</ins> to f2i Video file**

-r : REVERT a <ins>__f2i Video file__</ins> to its original file**

-v : Version Info

## Dependencies  
* FFmpeg - [Website][FFmpeg.org] / [Homebrew][FFmpeg.brew]

* A C language compiler most common would be GCC or Clang.
* Cmake to run the custom Makefile for fast instalation.
* Code was written to run on Unix based systems, it would likely work on a windows machine too but is currently untested.
